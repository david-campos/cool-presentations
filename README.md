# Cool Presentations

*Cool Presentations* is intended to be a webpage to provide interactive presentations for general purpose (teaching, conferences...).
The presentator can interact in real time with the attendants adding interactive elements (e.g. enquiries) which will be updated in real
time for both presentator and attendants. It is licensed under Apache License and will always be OpenSource and free.

**All pull requests are welcome, we will revise them and accept the ones which fit our vision of the project.**

As it was created for a project inside a subject, time was short and, at the moment of writing these lines, the design needs some refactor
(separate back-end from front-end using a REST API in json, many security vulnerabilities, object orientation, more documentation...).
Soon we will be working on this.

Original idea by David Campos, Rub√©n Bagan and Esteve Oria
